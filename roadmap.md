# ðŸš€ Roadmap: Workout Tracker NLP

This roadmap outlines the next phases of development for expanding **Workout Tracker NLP** into a more intelligent, scalable, and production-ready system.

---

## âœ… Current State
- Accepts natural language input about workouts (e.g. *"30 min cycling and 15 pushups"*).
- Uses **Nutritionix API** to parse exercises and estimate calories burned.
- Logs structured data into **Google Sheets** via Sheety API.
- Securely manages environment variables and API keys.

---

## ðŸ”® Next Steps

### 1. GPT Integration (AI Coaching)
- Integrate **OpenAI GPT models** to provide:
  - Workout recommendations.
  - Personalized coaching feedback.
  - Natural conversation for logging and querying past workouts.
- Example: *"What should I do for upper body strength this week?"*

### 2. FastAPI Backend
- Replace the script-based workflow with a **FastAPI backend**:
  - REST endpoints for submitting workouts and fetching logs.
  - Authentication & rate limiting.
  - Easier integration with web/mobile apps.

### 3. Database & Persistence
- Move from Google Sheets â†’ **PostgreSQL** or **SQLite**.
- Add models for:
  - Users
  - Workouts
  - Nutrition (optional future scope)

### 4. Dashboards & Analytics
- Create **interactive dashboards** with:
  - Calorie trends.
  - Workout frequency tracking.
  - Exercise type distribution.
- Tools: **Streamlit**, **Plotly Dash**, or frontend frameworks like React.

### 5. Automation & Notifications
- Daily/weekly progress summaries via:
  - Email
  - Slack
  - WhatsApp/SMS (Twilio)
- Example: *"You burned 1,200 calories this week across 5 workouts!"*

### 6. Scaling & Deployment
- Deploy backend on **Render / Railway / AWS / GCP**.
- Dockerize for portability.
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions.

## ðŸŒŸ Future Vision
Build a **personal AI fitness assistant** that:
- Converses naturally (via GPT).
- Tracks workouts and nutrition.
- Provides adaptive plans based on past performance.
- Integrates wearables (Fitbit, Apple Watch, etc.).
- Supports social features: compare progress with friends.
